# Plant-Growing-Project
project 1
You can grow your own plants- keep playing as long as your plants are alive! Be careful though, be sure to keep them watered and that they have sunlight :) 
Too much can kill them! The computer will try and sabotage you!

I've always liked the colors pink and green, and I always think of plants for whatever reason. Irl, I suck at growing plants so I figured to make a competitive virtual game!
